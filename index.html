                <p><strong>Paid by:</strong> Edward Atkinson (BM, MM, PD)</p>
                <p><strong>Reason:</strong> This site is an offering: it's my way to pay back all the generosity I received. I earned 3 degrees for free, and have had 3 careers in music, software development, and tournament poker. I'm sharing everything here, at no cost.</p>
				<p>Get started with <strong><a href="choirsnacks.html">Choir Snacks: free daily 5-minute voice lessons from me</a></strong>, over 4 weeks. I've taught over 2,000 people, with students singing at the Metropolitan Opera, recording studios in New York, and performing in churches and choirs across the United States. More than 400 churches used to pay $300 a year for Choir Snacks: but now it's free.</p>
				<p>You can also <strong><a href="https://edward-atkinson.kit.com/5ed42c0673" target="_blank">get my unmonetized, no cost newsletter</a></strong>. My newsletter is about navigating broken systems to your advantage: like corporate careers, university systems, churches, and poker tournaments.</p>
				<p>Much more to come soon. I've moved my web hosting to GitHub pages (free, down from $300/yr) and video hosting to YouTube (free, down from $200/yr) so that I can offer everything I create for free. It will take some time to re-parent everything. I'm excited to share.</p>
				<p>If you like something, share it with a friend by text or email.</p>
				<p>If you want to get alerted when everything I have created and will create gets published (all at no cost to you), sign-up for my newsletter (above) and I'll make an announcement there.</p>
