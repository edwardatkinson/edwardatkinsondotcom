            <h1>Hi, I'm Edward. I'm a singing teacher with 3 university degrees and 17 competitive awards. Everything on this website is free. I share the best things I've learned, and give them away.</h1>
            <p>
                I’ve worked internationally as a studio session singer, operatic tenor, choral conductor, organist, advertising executive, construction worker, web developer, and professional poker player! I won 17 competitive awards along the way.<br><br>
                My teaching philosophy is this: no bullshit, just the goods, with love. And I love my students.<br><br>
                Helping others grow is my favorite thing to do.<br><br>
                ‍- Edward Atkinson, BM, MM, PD
