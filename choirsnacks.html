            <h2>Level Up Your Choir: Get Choir Snacks - Now 100% FREE on YouTube!</h2>

            <p>Tired of repeating the same vocal instructions week after week? Wish your volunteer singers had access to expert training without breaking the bank (or your schedule)?</p>

            <h3>The Solution: Choir Snacks</h3>
            <p>Choir Snacks <em>was</em> the secret weapon for directors seeking excellence. It delivered bite-sized, 5-minute daily voice lessons based on proven pedagogy, designed for singers to use at home.</p>

            <h3>The Big News: It's All FREE Now!</h3>
            <p>That's right. The <strong>entire</strong> Choir Snacks video library is now available <strong>completely free</strong> on YouTube.</p>

            <h4>Why the Change?</h4>
            <p>Building and maintaining the Choir Snacks software platform was expensive! Rather than let this valuable resource disappear, I decided the best way forward was to give back to the choral community that I love. So, I'm making all the lessons freely accessible to everyone.</p>

            <p><strong>No Logins. No Fees. No Catch. Just World-Class Vocal Training.</strong></p>

            <h3>What You Get:</h3>

                <li><strong>Build Vocal Mastery:</strong> Develop technique, breath support, resonance, and more – concepts explained simply.</li>
                <li><strong>Save Director Time:</strong> Eliminate repetitive instruction in rehearsal. Let Choir Snacks handle the foundational work.</li>
